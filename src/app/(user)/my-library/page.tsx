                I would be happy to help, but I need more details about what you would like this page to do. Could you clarify:

                - What should the My<b> Library </b> page display?
                - Should it show a list of books, user profile, or something else?
                - What features do you need?

                Once you provide more context, I can help you write the appropriate component code.
        </div>
    );
};

export default page;
